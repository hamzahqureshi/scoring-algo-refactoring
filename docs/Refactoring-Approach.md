# Refactoring Approach - Scoring Algorithm Project

## Overview

This document describes the step-by-step approach taken to refactor the scoring algorithm in the SurveyResponseService, including the rationale, phases, and best practices followed.

---

## Rationale for Refactoring

- **Maintainability:** The original `SurveyResponseService` was a large, monolithic class (184 lines) with mixed responsibilities, making it hard to test, extend, and debug.
- **Separation of Concerns:** Scoring logic, aggregation, AI integration, and persistence were tightly coupled.
- **Scalability:** The design needed to support future enhancements, such as new scoring strategies or AI models.
- **Testability:** Isolating logic into focused services enables more granular and reliable unit and integration testing.

## Refactoring Phases

### **Phase 1: Analysis & Planning**
- Copied the original `SurveyResponseService` for reference.
- Analyzed the code to identify distinct responsibilities:
  - Question scoring logic
  - Score aggregation and final calculation
  - Orchestration, persistence, and error handling
- Defined clear boundaries for new services:
  - `CentralScoringEngine` for question-level scoring
  - `ScoreCompositionService` for aggregation and final score
  - `SurveyResponseService` for orchestration

### **Phase 2: Extract CentralScoringEngine**
- Created the `CentralScoringEngine` interface and implementation.
- Moved all question scoring logic (including AI integration) into this service.
- Ensured the service is stateless and testable.
- Wrote comprehensive unit tests for all question types and edge cases.

### **Phase 3: Extract ScoreCompositionService**
- Created the `ScoreCompositionService` interface and implementation.
- Moved all pillar aggregation and final score calculation logic here.
- Supported dynamic pillar configurations and company-specific weights.
- Wrote comprehensive unit tests for aggregation and calculation scenarios.

### **Phase 4: Refactor SurveyResponseService**
- Refactored `SurveyResponseService` to delegate scoring and aggregation to the new services.
- Reduced the main orchestration method from 184 to 41 lines.
- Kept only orchestration, persistence, and error handling in this service.
- Verified that all original functionality was preserved.

### **Phase 5: Testing & Documentation**
- Created integration tests to verify the full workflow and error handling.
- Documented the AI workflow, design, and refactoring approach.
- Ensured all tests passed and committed changes after each phase.

## Best Practices Followed

- **Incremental Refactoring:** Each phase was completed and tested before moving to the next.
- **Comprehensive Testing:** Unit and integration tests were written for all new services and workflows.
- **Documentation:** Each phase and architectural decision was documented for future maintainers.
- **Separation of Concerns:** Each service has a single, well-defined responsibility.
- **Dependency Injection:** All services are Spring-managed beans, enabling easy mocking and testing.
- **Error Handling:** Graceful fallback and error propagation were implemented throughout.

---

## Outcome

- The main service was reduced from 184 to 41 lines.
- All original functionality was preserved and test coverage improved.
- The codebase is now modular, maintainable, and ready for future enhancements.

## Next Steps

- Review and update documentation as the system evolves.
- Continue to follow modular and test-driven development practices for future features.
